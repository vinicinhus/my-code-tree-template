# Code Tree Template

Creating a well-organized folder structure for your software projects is essential for maintaining clarity and efficiency. Here's a suggested folder structure that you can adapt and customize based on your specific needs:

**Root Folder (Project Name):** Keep the name of your project here.

**Documentation (docs):** Store all project documentation, including requirements, design documents, user manuals, and any other relevant information.

**Source Code (src):** Divide this into subfolders based on the programming languages or frameworks used in your project.

For example:

- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- C#

**Tests (test):** Include all test-related files, such as unit tests, integration tests, and test data.

**Configurations (config):** Store configuration files for your project, including environment-specific configurations, build configurations, and any other necessary settings.

**Resources (resources):** Keep all project resources such as images, icons, audio files, or any other assets used in your software.

**Tools (tools):** Store any tools or utilities specific to your project, such as scripts, build tools, or custom software.

**Deployment (deploy):** Include deployment scripts, configuration files, and any other resources needed for deploying your software.

**Miscellaneous (misc):** This folder can be used for any additional files or resources that don't fit into the other categories.

Remember, this is just a suggested structure. Feel free to customize it based on your project's specific requirements and workflow.
